# ApproximateAnaFlow<br>
- The AZechCRP.py file includes the Python code for evaluating the drawdown values due to CRP for confined flow.
- The AZechCHP.py file contains the code for evaluating the drawdown and wellbore flow values due to CHP for confined flow, where the case of CHP have not been considered in the past studies.<br><br>
_Note: CRP stands for constant-rate pumping and CHP stands for constant-rate pumping_
