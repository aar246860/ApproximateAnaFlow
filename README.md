- The AZechCRP.py file includes the Python code for evaluating the drawdown values due to CRP for confined flow.
- The AZechCHP.py file contains the code for evaluating the drawdown and wellbore flow values due to CHP for confined flow.<br><br>
_Note: CRP stands for constant-rate pumping and CHP stands for constant-rate pumping_
